Both Config files automatically build all new solar configurations for the base network. This could cause the netwoek to be extremely large (â‰ˆ 10 GB). 
To discard new solar configurations from base network, remove them from 'extemdable_carriers' and 'renewable_carriers'. 
To discard new solar configurations manually before the prenetwrok is built, add them to the 'to_remove' list in add_new_solar in prepare_sector_network : https://github.com/Parisra/Solar-Transition-Paper/blob/56420b9282cef8b597521cf66c9eedae2aa67233/scripts/prepare_sector_network.py#L1334
